# populating-dropdown-list-from-database-using-ajax-and-php
this project autoload sub-select field after an option is picked from the dropdown.
I first built my html form with bootstrap with the continent, country, state, and city fields.
The logic behind this is that if i select a continent the countries under it should be the only option i see in the option field for country.
Also I should not be able to select country or state without selecting a continent.
The same goes for every field.
The AJAX send request without having to load the page.
The data is gotten from the database.
